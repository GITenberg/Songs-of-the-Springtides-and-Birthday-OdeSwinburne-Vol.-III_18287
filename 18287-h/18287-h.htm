<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Upon the flowery forefront of the year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One wandering by the grey-green April sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found on a reach of shingle and shallower sand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inlaid with starrier glimmering jewellery<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left for the sun's love and the light wind's cheer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the foam-flowered strand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breeze-brightened, something nearer sea than land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the last shoreward blossom-fringe was near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A babe asleep with flower-soft face that gleamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sun and seaward as it laughed and dreamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too sure of either love for either's fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Albeit so birdlike slight and light, it seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor man nor mortal child of man, but fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As even its twin-born tenderer spray-flowers were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the wind scatters like an Oread's hair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For when July strewed fire on earth and sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last time ere that year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the flame of morn Cymothoe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld one brighter than the sunbright sphere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Move toward her from its fieriest heart, whence trod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The live sun's very God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the foam-bright water-ways that are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As heavenlier heavens with star for answering star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on her eyes and hair and maiden mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt a kiss falling fierier than the South</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard above afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A noise of songs and wind-enamoured wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lutes and lyres of milder and mightier strings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round the resonant radiance of his car<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where depth is one with height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light heard as music, music seen as light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with that second moondawn of the spring's<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fosters the first rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sun-child whiter than the sunlit snows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was born out of the world of sunless things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That round the round earth flows and ebbs and flows.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But he that found the sea-flower by the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took to foster like a graft of earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was born of man's most highest and heavenliest birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free-born as winds and stars and waves are free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A warrior grey with glories more than years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though more of years than change the quick to dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had rained their light and darkness on his head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A singer that in time's and memory's ears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should leave such words to sing as all his peers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might praise with hallowing heat of rapturous tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till all the days of human flight were fled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at his knees his fosterling was fed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not with man's wine and bread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor mortal mother-milk of hopes and fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But food of deep memorial days long sped;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For bread with wisdom and with song for wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear as the full calm's emerald hyaline.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from his grave glad lips the boy would gather<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fine honey of song-notes goldener than gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More sweet than bees make of the breathing heather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he, as glad and bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might drink as they, and keep his spirit from cold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the boy loved his laurel-laden hair</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As his own father's risen on the eastern air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that less white brow-binding bayleaf bloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than all flowers his father's eyes relume;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those high songs he heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than all notes of any landward bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than all sounds less free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the wind's quiring to the choral sea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">High things the high song taught him; how the breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too frail for life may be more strong than death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this poor flash of sense in life, that gleams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a ghost's glory in dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More stabile than the world's own heart's root seems,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By that strong faith of lordliest love which gives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To death's own sightless-seeming eyes a light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clearer, to death's bare bones a verier might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than shines or strikes from any man that lives.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he that loves life overmuch shall die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dog's death, utterly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he that much less loves it than he hates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All wrongdoing that is done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anywhere always underneath the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall live a mightier life than time's or fate's.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One fairer thing he shewed him, and in might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More strong than day and night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose strengths build up time's towering period:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, one thing stronger and more high than God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which if man had not, then should God not be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that was Liberty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gladly should man die to gain, he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freedom; and gladlier, having lost, lie dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For man's earth was not, nor the sweet sea-waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His, nor his own land, nor its very graves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except they bred not, bore not, hid not slaves:</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all of all that is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were one man free in body and soul, were his.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the song softened, even as heaven by night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softens, from sunnier down to starrier light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with its moonbright breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed life for death's sake, and for life's sake death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till as the moon's own beam and breath confuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one clear hueless haze of glimmering hues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea's line and the land's line and the sky's,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And light for love of darkness almost dies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As darkness only lives for light's dear love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose hands the web of night is woven of,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So in that heaven of wondrous words were life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And death brought out of strife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, by that strong spell of serene increase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought out of strife to peace.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the song lightened, as the wind at morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashes, and even with lightning of the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night's thick-spun web is thinned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all its weft unwoven and overworn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrinks, as might love from scorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as when wind and light on water and land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leap as twin gods from heavenward hand in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the sound and splendour of their leap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strike darkness dead, and daunt the spirit of sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And burn it up with fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So with the light that lightened from the lyre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was all the bright heat in the child's heart stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blown with blasts of music into flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till even his sense became<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire, as the sense that fires the singing bird<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose song calls night by name.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the soul within the sense began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The manlike passion of a godlike man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the sense within the soul again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thoughts that make men of gods and gods of men.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For love the high song taught him: love that turns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God's heart toward man as man's to Godward; love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That life and death and life are fashioned of,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the first breath that burns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half kindled on the flowerlike yeanling's lip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So light and faint that life seems like to slip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that yet weaklier drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When sunset dies of night's devouring dawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the man dying not wholly as all men dies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If aught be left of his in live men's eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the dawnless dark of death to rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If aught of deed or word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be seen for all time or of all time heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love, that though body and soul were overthrown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should live for love's sake of itself alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though spirit and flesh were one thing doomed and dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not wholly annihilated.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing even the hoariest ash-flake that the pyre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drops, and forgets the thing was once afire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave its heart to feed the pile's full flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till its own heart its own heat overcame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outlives its own life, though by scarce a span,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As such men dying outlive themselves in man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outlive themselves for ever; if the heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outburn the heart that kindled it, the sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outlast the flower whose soul it was, and flit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth of the body of it</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into some new shape of a strange perfume<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More potent than its light live spirit of bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How shall not something of that soul relive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That only soul that had such gifts to give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As lighten something even of all men's doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even from the labouring womb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even to the seal set on the unopening tomb?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these the loving light of song and love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall wrap and lap round and impend above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imperishable; and all springs born illume<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sleep with brighter thoughts than wake the dove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To music, when the hillside winds resume<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The marriage-song of heather-flower and broom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the joy thereof.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And hate the song too taught him: hate of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That brings or holds in thrall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of spirit or flesh, free-born ere God began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The holy body and sacred soul of man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wheresoever a curse was or a chain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A throne for torment or a crown for bane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose, moulded out of poor men's molten pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, said he, should man's heaviest hate be set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inexorably, to faint not or forget<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the last warmth bled forth of the last vein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In flesh that none should call a king's again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing wolves and dogs and birds that plague-strike air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave the last bone of all the carrion bare.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And hope the high song taught him: hope whose eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can sound the seas unsoundable, the skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inaccessible of eyesight; that can see</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What earth beholds not, hear what wind and sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear not, and speak what all these crying in one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can speak not to the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in her sovereign eyelight all things are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear as the closest seen and kindlier star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That marries morn and even and winter and spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one love's golden ring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she can see the days of man, the birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of good and death of evil things on earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inevitable and infinite, and sure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As present pain is, or herself is pure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, she can hear and see, beyond all things<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With all strong wrath of all sheer winds that blew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All glories of all storms of the air that fell<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From sunward on her sunniest shower-struck wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tears and laughter for the dew-dropt thing,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slight as indeed a dew-drop, by the sea<br /></span>

<span class="i0">God-featured, with god's eyes; and in their might<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A dumb thing mild and hurtless; nor at first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his bowed eyes seemed any light to come,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Pleading for pity of piteous lips and eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He strayed with faint bare lily-lovely feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helpless, and flowerlike sweet:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The youth bespake him softly; but there fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the sweet lips no sweet word audible<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No sound to make the dim cold silence glad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No breath to thaw the hard harsh air with heat;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His mute mouth opened, and his first word came:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Knowest thou me now by name?'<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As of one shadowing heaven and lightening hell;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And darkens with its darkness far-off sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereon the sky leans red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a voice that stilled the winds he said:<br /></span>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
